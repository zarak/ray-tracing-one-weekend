# Ray Tracing in One Weekend 

[![Haskell CI](https://github.com/zarak/ray-tracing-one-weekend/actions/workflows/ray-tracing.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zarak/ray-tracing-one-weekend/actions/workflows/ray-tracing.yaml)

This repository is based on the book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The code is my own implementation in Haskell, whereas the book uses C++.
